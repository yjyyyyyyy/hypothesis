> This repository wrote some philosophical questions about the whims of the author and the author's friends. I felt that just having an idea was not enough, so I wrote it on GitHub

## Hypothesis about interdimensional creatures
***Hypothesis about the existence of interdimensional creatures***

>The teacher of morality and law asked us a question: "*Human imitation of language belongs to learning, so does the dialogue between AI programs such as siri and human beings belong to learning?" The answer given by the teacher is no. She said that the AI program is only running the code edited by humans and the instructions given by humans. If humans do not edit instructions, the program will not run.

My hypothesis is:
About my understanding of AI is the second-dimensional existence constructed by human beings (third-dimensional creatures), virtual existence. (I don't know how it is defined academically.) Humans give instructions, and the second dimension runs.
Then if the third-dimensional space we are in is also a virtual space created by a higher-level meta-space, do we exist in the highest-dimensional space or in the second-to-last high-dimensional space? . The second-dimensional space created by human beings has not been fully developed for the time being, and we probably have not used the second-dimensional to control the next dimension (I don’t know if it counts as using a program to write a program.) If my hypothesis is It is established that we are in the highest or the penultimate dimensional space, and there is no other possibility for either. That is to say, we may be controlled by higher-dimensional beings, and for them we are only virtual, our audio, visual, smell, taste, touch, thoughts, and emotions are all controlled, we are just running programs, any of our Perceptions and moods, every action we do next, may be pre-planned, including my assumptions. The environment in which we live, the earth, and even the universe may be a space constructed by them. Then who is controlling us, who wrote the programs, why do we run their programs, and why they control us to control our AI, I don't know. What is the meaning of this hypothesis when I think about it? Is it to get rid of the control of the existence of high-dimensional space? Since it is already controlled, how can I get rid of it? Some people may think: As long as we continue to progress in the third dimension on Earth, it is possible to reach the technological level of creatures in high-dimensional space. . But have you ever thought that if my hypothesis exists, then our technological progress is still controlled by creatures in high-dimensional space, and creatures in high-dimensional space are also controlled by creatures in higher-dimensional space; while we are making progress, high-dimensional space Creatures are also progressing, and higher-dimensional space creatures are also progressing. So who has the ultimate control, and who occupies the space for progress and stands at the pinnacle of technology? ? I still don't know.
  
Maybe this hypothesis is boring, but I don't find it boring to think about it. Or maybe there are many predecessors and philosophers who have thought about this kind of problem. Of course, I have thought about this question countless times from other perspectives, and there has been no answer, but for our creatures in the third-dimensional space, the answer to this question must be open.

## Opinion of congenital insufficiency
***Questions about my prejudice against "disabled"***

> There are many congenital diseases or deficiencies, or just different from ordinary people, that people define as *unhealthy*. Such an *unhealthy* presence usually requires treatment. There are many ways of treatment, such as *drug therapy*, *surgery* and so on. Healing *unhealthy* people to fit the physical health of the general public through therapy. It's like the whole world is full of zombies, but we don't know, we think we are healthy, but maybe we are all zombies, those who are abnormal in our eyes, such as *schizophrenia* People, maybe they are normal people (the above is my understanding)

My opinion is:
If there is such a possibility. The so-called *unhealthy* human being is the most original human appearance, and other people are really *mutated*. Perhaps because there are so many mutated humans, people later think that our current *healthy* appearance is the original human appearance.
The answer is no. Perhaps the so-called *disability* and *congenital defect* are the original appearance of human beings. What is certain is that it is not your body that is disabled, but the mind of the public. When most people are distorted into uniformity, the definition is changed. Injections of drugs and surgical treatment may be nothing more than "healing" a normal person into a standard of public aesthetics. But where does this aesthetic come from? Perhaps you would say that congenital defects cause inconvenience in the lives of disabled people, affecting their own mobility. So what is the purpose of facilitation? It is to fulfill the duty of coexistence with others. When other people do something with their hands, it doesn't mean you have to do it or you have to do it with both hands. do it in your own way. Don't be bound by anything or implicit rules, you can enjoy what the world deserves with any part of your body, no need to go along. No one is ever obliged to consider gregariousness.
