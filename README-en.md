## Introduction
> This repository wrote some philosophical questions about the whims of the author and the author's friends. I felt that just having an idea was not enough, so I wrote it on GitHub

## Hypothesis about interdimensional creatures
***Hypothesis about the existence of interdimensional creatures***

>The teacher of morality and law asked us a question: "*Human imitating language belongs to learning, so does Siri and other AI programsands talking to humans belongs to learning?*" The answer given by the teacher is *false* . She said that the AI program was only running the code edited by humans and the instructions given by humans. If humans did not edit any instructions, the program would not run.

My hypothesis is that:  
About my understanding of AI is *the second-dimensional existence constructed by human beings (third-dimensional creatures), virtual existence. (I don't know how it is defined academically.)* Humans give instructions, and the second dimension runs.
Then if the third-dimensional space we are in is also a virtual space created by a higher-level meta-space, are we existing in the highest-dimensional space or in the second-to-last high-dimensional space? The second-dimensional space created by human beings has not been fully developed for the time being, and we probably have not used the second-dimensional to control the next dimension (I don’t know if it counts as using a program to write a program.) If my hypothesis established，then we must be in the highest or the penultimate dimensional space, and there is no other possibility for either. That is to say, we may be controlled by higher-dimensional beings, and for them，we were only virtual, our audio, visual, smell, taste, touch, thoughts, and emotions were all being controlled, we were just running programs, any of our Perceptions and moods, every action we do next, may be pre-planned, including my assumptions. The environment in which we living in, the earth, and even the universe may be a space constructed by them. Then who were controlling us, who wrote the programs, why did we run their programs, and why they control us to control our AI？ I don't know. What is the meaning of this hypothesis when I think about it? Is it to get rid of the control of the existence of high-dimensional space? Since it was already being controlled, how could we get rid of it? Some people may think that *As long as we continue to progress in the third dimension on Earth, it is possible to reach the technological level of creatures in high-dimensional space.* But have you ever thought that if my hypothesis existed, then our technological progress was still being controlled by creatures in high-dimensional space, and creatures in high-dimensional space were also being controlled by creatures in higher-dimensional space; while we were making progress, high-dimensional space Creatures were also progressing, and higher-dimensional space creatures were also progressing... So who has the ultimate control, and who occupies the space for progress and stands at the pinnacle of technology? ? I still don't know.
  
Maybe this hypothesis is boring, but I don't think that it is boring to think about it. Probably there are many predecessors and philosophers who have thought about this kind of problem. Of course, I have thought about this question countless times from other perspectives, and there has been no answer, but for our creatures in the third-dimensional space, the answer to this question must be open.

## Opinion of “congenital insufficiency”
***Regarding my doubts about the term "disabled"***

> There are many congenital diseases or deficiencies, or just different from ordinary people, that people define as *unhealthy*. Such an *unhealthy* presence usually requires treatment. There are many ways of treatment, such as *drug therapy*, *surgery* and so on. Healing *unhealthy* people to fit the physical health of the general public through therapy. It's like the whole world is full of zombies, but we don't know, we think we are healthy, but maybe we are all zombies, those who are abnormal in our eyes, such as *schizophrenia* People, maybe they are normal people (the above is my understanding)

My opinion is:   
If there is such a possibility. The so-called *unhealthy* human being is the most original human appearance, and other people are really *mutated*. Perhaps because there are so many mutated humans, people later think that our current *healthy* appearance is the original human appearance.
The answer is no. Perhaps the so-called *disability* and *congenital defect* are the original appearance of human beings. What is certain is that it is not your body that is disabled, but the mind of the public. When most people are distorted into uniformity, the definition is changed. Injections of drugs and surgical treatment may be nothing more than "healing" a normal person into a standard of public aesthetics. But where does this aesthetic come from? Perhaps you would say that congenital defects cause inconvenience in the lives of disabled people, affecting their own mobility. So what is the purpose of facilitation? It is to fulfill the duty of coexistence with others. When other people do something with their hands, it doesn't mean you have to do it or you have to do it with both hands. do it in your own way. Don't be bound by anything or implicit rules, you can enjoy what the world deserves with any part of your body, no need to go along. No one is ever obliged to consider gregariousness.

## The meaning of human existence
***Talk about the meaning of human existence***
  
> Have you ever wondered what the meaning of human existence is? After all, people will die, so why try to live? Why are you greedy for fame and fortune? Why do human beings exist on this earth and why are they trying to rule the world?

Our thinking is:  
Humans are ordinary primates, but compared to other animals, we have our own mind and consciousness. Hence the term psychology and philosophy. From a psychological point of view, people are greedy for fame and fortune. Since ancient times, all rulers have longed to rule the world and long for immortality. Of course, this is impossible. After understanding this impossibility, he will still do his best to achieve the goal of ruling, for the sake of his fame after his death, for his own reputation. People come to this world to see the flowers, trees, mountains and rivers in this world, to leave traces of their past on this beautiful planet, and to see more life and things. Even if the good memories cease to exist after we die, the short-lived happiness is worthwhile. How can our life be called a success if we just keep spending time, energy, crying and grief for things that are not worth it? We are greedy for life because we are afraid of losing the things that make us happy; on the contrary, some people think that there is no point in living because there is nothing that can make them happy. What are the things that make us happy? It is those worthy sights, other worthy lives, or the pleasure brought by fame and achievement. In the final analysis, the meaning of human existence is to enjoy the things worthwhile in this world.

## If your game suddenly stops serving
***How would you react if the game you were playing would be stop servicing tomorrow?***

> Do you play video games? Video games have become a way of entertainment for many teenagers, and recharging video games has become the norm. Many people spend a lot of time, energy and money on video games. When game are suddenly stop servicing, or when the game is unloaded and their previous efforts are wasted, they usually become upset because the results they have spent time, energy and money on are lost in a flash. This proves how important game records are to players. What will happen if your game suddenly stops serving at this moment?

Imagine you're deeply addicted to a game, you top it up with some money, and you work hard to create a brilliant record in the game. But just as you were addicted to the game and playing it hot, the game stopped serving overnight. All the records you've created are gone, and you don't know where the money you've recharged is going. You live without games, because you are addicted to games all year round, and you can hardly take care of yourself. At this point, all that remains in your heart is confusion and helplessness. When you are bored, you flip through the news and find that there are countless players like you, some sad and some angry. You also learned that some programmers are already trying to restore the game and trying to recover your data. The programmer's idea is strongly supported by many players, and if the programmer successfully recovers the player's data, they will become heroes to the player. During this time, you go through a painful wait, but the results is only the officially notified of failure  

Back to the point, why do you and other players in our story become emotionally bad, confused, and helpless after losing this video game? Perhaps because you have become too dependent on this video game, your brain and mind are controlled by this virtual video game, which has become your spiritual sustenance; Another thing is that because you have spent a lot of time and money on this video game, you can't accept that the energy and money you put in up front of you don't know where to go at this moment.
What I want to say is: the one in the story is better being a  programmer and becoming the hero in the players of in the story than playing game; Instead of putting so much into the game, it is better to do something actually meaningful, the game can be stopped and disappeared, but 1+1 is always equal to 2, and the same is true until the world is destroyed.

## The hypothesis of life
***The hypothesis about "life is like a game"***  
> Life may be an immersive VR game, our space may be fictitious, and everyone around you may be the NPC of the game.
> Before the game starts, your previous life memories will be cleared and everything will start from scratch. The historical figures or events you learned in your life, such as Newton, Beethoven and Qin Shihuang, are most likely fictional. (You may ask, "How can their remains be proved?" If my hypothesis is true, their remains are also created by the game program)

During the game, you need to constantly explore and learn in this virtual VR space to survive in the game. You will see many things and people and master many skills. In the early stage of the game (your childhood), you are not very familiar with the social unspoken rules of the game, so you need the help and tips of adults (NPC); Through constant exploration, you will gradually adapt and become proficient in survival. If you are proficient in survival skills and have no accidental death, then at the end of the game, you really understand the social unspoken rule of the game, and your life will eventually come to an end.  

If our hypothesis is true, life is a game, why not live happily through this life and give yourself a good game experience? If possible, we should try every possibility in life, learn every skill, and try to live more brilliantly in this short game, which is meaningful.
