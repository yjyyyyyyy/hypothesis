## Introduction
> This repository wrote some philosophical questions about the whims of the author and the author's friends. I felt that just having an idea was not enough, so I wrote it on GitHub

## Hypothesis about interdimensional creatures
***Hypothesis about the existence of interdimensional creatures***

>The teacher of morality and law asked us a question: "*Human imitating language belongs to learning, so does Siri and other AI programsands talking to humans belongs to learning?*" The answer given by the teacher is *false* . She said that the AI program was only running the code edited by humans and the instructions given by humans. If humans did not edit any instructions, the program would not run.

My hypothesis is that:  
About my understanding of AI is *the second-dimensional existence constructed by human beings (third-dimensional creatures), virtual existence. (I don't know how it is defined academically.)* Humans give instructions, and the second dimension runs.
Then if the third-dimensional space we are in is also a virtual space created by a higher-level meta-space, are we existing in the highest-dimensional space or in the second-to-last high-dimensional space? The second-dimensional space created by human beings has not been fully developed for the time being, and we probably have not used the second-dimensional to control the next dimension (I don’t know if it counts as using a program to write a program.) If my hypothesis established，then we must be in the highest or the penultimate dimensional space, and there is no other possibility for either. That is to say, we may be controlled by higher-dimensional beings, and for them，we were only virtual, our audio, visual, smell, taste, touch, thoughts, and emotions were all being controlled, we were just running programs, any of our Perceptions and moods, every action we do next, may be pre-planned, including my assumptions. The environment in which we living in, the earth, and even the universe may be a space constructed by them. Then who were controlling us, who wrote the programs, why did we run their programs, and why they control us to control our AI？ I don't know. What is the meaning of this hypothesis when I think about it? Is it to get rid of the control of the existence of high-dimensional space? Since it was already being controlled, how could we get rid of it? Some people may think that *As long as we continue to progress in the third dimension on Earth, it is possible to reach the technological level of creatures in high-dimensional space.* But have you ever thought that if my hypothesis existed, then our technological progress was still being controlled by creatures in high-dimensional space, and creatures in high-dimensional space were also being controlled by creatures in higher-dimensional space; while we were making progress, high-dimensional space Creatures were also progressing, and higher-dimensional space creatures were also progressing... So who has the ultimate control, and who occupies the space for progress and stands at the pinnacle of technology? ? I still don't know.
  
Maybe this hypothesis is boring, but I don't think that it is boring to think about it. Probably there are many predecessors and philosophers who have thought about this kind of problem. Of course, I have thought about this question countless times from other perspectives, and there has been no answer, but for our creatures in the third-dimensional space, the answer to this question must be open.

## Opinion of “congenital insufficiency”
***Regarding my doubts about the term "disabled"***

> There are many congenital diseases or deficiencies, or just different from ordinary people, that people define as *unhealthy*. Such an *unhealthy* presence usually requires treatment. There are many ways of treatment, such as *drug therapy*, *surgery* and so on. Healing *unhealthy* people to fit the physical health of the general public through therapy. It's like the whole world is full of zombies, but we don't know, we think we are healthy, but maybe we are all zombies, those who are abnormal in our eyes, such as *schizophrenia* People, maybe they are normal people (the above is my understanding)

My opinion is:   
If there is such a possibility. The so-called *unhealthy* human being is the most original human appearance, and other people are really *mutated*. Perhaps because there are so many mutated humans, people later think that our current *healthy* appearance is the original human appearance.
The answer is no. Perhaps the so-called *disability* and *congenital defect* are the original appearance of human beings. What is certain is that it is not your body that is disabled, but the mind of the public. When most people are distorted into uniformity, the definition is changed. Injections of drugs and surgical treatment may be nothing more than "healing" a normal person into a standard of public aesthetics. But where does this aesthetic come from? Perhaps you would say that congenital defects cause inconvenience in the lives of disabled people, affecting their own mobility. So what is the purpose of facilitation? It is to fulfill the duty of coexistence with others. When other people do something with their hands, it doesn't mean you have to do it or you have to do it with both hands. do it in your own way. Don't be bound by anything or implicit rules, you can enjoy what the world deserves with any part of your body, no need to go along. No one is ever obliged to consider gregariousness.

## The meaning of human existence
***Talk about the meaning of human existence***
  
> Have you ever wondered what the meaning of human existence is? After all, people will die, so why try to live? Why are you greedy for fame and fortune? Why do human beings exist on this earth and why are they trying to rule the world?

Our thinking is:  
Humans are ordinary primates, but compared to other animals, we have our own mind and consciousness. Hence the term psychology and philosophy. From a psychological point of view, people are greedy for fame and fortune. Since ancient times, all rulers have longed to rule the world and long for immortality. Of course, this is impossible. After understanding this impossibility, he will still do his best to achieve the goal of ruling, for the sake of his fame after his death, for his own reputation. People come to this world to see the flowers, trees, mountains and rivers in this world, to leave traces of their past on this beautiful planet, and to see more life and things. Even if the good memories cease to exist after we die, the short-lived happiness is worthwhile. How can our life be called a success if we just keep spending time, energy, crying and grief for things that are not worth it? We are greedy for life because we are afraid of losing the things that make us happy; on the contrary, some people think that there is no point in living because there is nothing that can make them happy. What are the things that make us happy? It is those worthy sights, other worthy lives, or the pleasure brought by fame and achievement. In the final analysis, the meaning of human existence is to enjoy the things worthwhile in this world.

## If your game suddenly stops serving
***How would you react if the game you were playing would be stop servicing tomorrow?***

> Do you play video games? Video games have become a way of entertainment for many teenagers, and recharging video games has become the norm. Many people spend a lot of time, energy and money on video games. When game are suddenly stop servicing, or when the game is unloaded and their previous efforts are wasted, they usually become upset because the results they have spent time, energy and money on are lost in a flash. This proves how important game records are to players. What will happen if your game suddenly stops serving at this moment?

想象一下，你深度沉迷一款游戏，你为其充值了一些金钱，你呕心沥血在游戏中创造了辉煌战绩。可是正当你沉迷这个游戏，玩得火热朝天时，游戏在一夜之间停服了。你所创造的战绩全部消失，你也不知道你充值的金钱流向了哪里。没有游戏的你度日如年，因为常年沉迷游戏，你的生活几乎无法自理。此时你的内心只剩下迷茫和无助。无聊时你翻看新闻，发现有无数玩家和你一样，有的难过有的愤怒。你又了解到：有的程序员已经在试图恢复这款游戏，同时在尝试恢复你们的数据。程序员的这个想法得到了许多玩家的大力支持，可是又掀起了一阵舆论：程序员如果成功恢复玩家们的数据，对玩家们来说，他们就将成为英雄；相反之，如果程序员没有成功恢复玩家们的数据，可能程序员将会受到大家的网络暴力。人们会说：“既然没有这样的技术，又何必宣扬？”
但是我们想说的是，程序员已经在为众多玩家尝试恢复他们的数据。没有义务去帮助大家，无论成功与否，玩家们都应该心怀感激。
回到正题，为何在我们的故事里，你和其它玩家在失去这个电子游戏后变得情绪糟糕、迷茫、无助呢？或许是因为你们已经过于依赖这个电子游戏了，你的大脑和思想被这个虚拟的电子游戏所操控，它成为了你的精神寄托；还有一点就是因为你在这款电子游戏上消耗了了大把的时间和金钱，你无法接受你前期所付出的精力和金钱在此刻不知去向。
