> This repository wrote some philosophical questions about the whims of the author and the author's friends. I felt that just having an idea was not enough, so I wrote it on GitHub

## Hypothesis about interdimensional creatures
***Hypothesis about the existence of interdimensional creatures***

>The teacher of morality and law asked us a question: "*Human imitation of language belongs to learning, so does the dialogue between AI programs such as siri and human beings belong to learning?" The answer given by the teacher is no. She said that the AI program is only running the code edited by humans and the instructions given by humans. If humans do not edit instructions, the program will not run.

My hypothesis is:
About my understanding of AI is the second-dimensional existence constructed by human beings (third-dimensional creatures), virtual existence. (I don't know how it is defined academically.) Humans give instructions, and the second dimension runs.
Then if the third-dimensional space we are in is also a virtual space created by a higher-level meta-space, do we exist in the highest-dimensional space or in the second-to-last high-dimensional space? . The second-dimensional space created by human beings has not been fully developed for the time being, and we probably have not used the second-dimensional to control the next dimension (I don’t know if it counts as using a program to write a program.) If my hypothesis is It is established that we are in the highest or the penultimate dimensional space, and there is no other possibility for either. That is to say, we may be controlled by higher-dimensional beings, and for them we are only virtual, our audio, visual, smell, taste, touch, thoughts, and emotions are all controlled, we are just running programs, any of our Perceptions and moods, every action we do next, may be pre-planned, including my assumptions. The environment in which we live, the earth, and even the universe may be a space constructed by them. Then who is controlling us, who wrote the programs, why do we run their programs, and why they control us to control our AI, I don't know. What is the meaning of this hypothesis when I think about it? Is it to get rid of the control of the existence of high-dimensional space? Since it is already controlled, how can I get rid of it? Some people may think: As long as we continue to progress in the third dimension on Earth, it is possible to reach the technological level of creatures in high-dimensional space. . But have you ever thought that if my hypothesis exists, then our technological progress is still controlled by creatures in high-dimensional space, and creatures in high-dimensional space are also controlled by creatures in higher-dimensional space; while we are making progress, high-dimensional space Creatures are also progressing, and higher-dimensional space creatures are also progressing. So who has the ultimate control, and who occupies the space for progress and stands at the pinnacle of technology? ? I still don't know.
  
Maybe this hypothesis is boring, but I don't find it boring to think about it. Or maybe there are many predecessors and philosophers who have thought about this kind of problem. Of course, I have thought about this question countless times from other perspectives, and there has been no answer, but for our creatures in the third-dimensional space, the answer to this question must be open.

## Opinion of congenital insufficiency
***关于人类对“残疾人”偏见的质疑***

> 有许多先天性疾病或不足，或是只是与常人的不同，都会被人们定义为*不健康*。此类*不健康*存在通常需要得到治疗。治疗的方式有许多，如*药物治疗*、*手术治疗*等。通过治疗将*不健康*的人医治成贴合大众的生理健康情况。就好比全世界都是丧尸，但是我们并不知道，我们自以为自己是健康的，但是或许我们每人都是丧尸，那些在我们眼里不正常的人，比如*精神分裂*这一类的人，有可能他们才是正常人（以上是我的理解）

我的想法是：
如果存在这样一种可能。所谓某种*不健康*的人类才是最本来的人类模样，其他人才是真的*变异*。或许因为变异的人类数量实在太多，因此后来人们就认为我们现在*健康*的模样才是人类原本的样子。
答案不然，或许所谓*残疾*、*先天性缺陷*才是人类最本初的模样，可以肯定的是：其实残疾的不是你的身体，不过是大众的思想罢了。当大部分人畸变成统一模样，定义就被改变了。注射药物、手术治疗或许不过就是将原本正常的人“医治”成符合大众审美的标准。然而此类审美又是从何而来的呢？或许你会说先天性缺陷导致残疾人生活上的不便，影响的是他们自己的行动便利。那么行动便利的目的又是什么呢？是为了完成与他人共存的义务吧。当其他人用双手完成一件事情，并不代表这件事你一定要去做或一定要用双手去做，这从来不是你生来的义务，你完全可以不做此事或换种方式完成此事，用你自己的方式完成此事。不要被任何事物或隐性规定束缚，你可以用你身体的任意一部分享受这个世界值得完成的事情，不需要随众处事。任何人，从来没有义务考虑合群。
